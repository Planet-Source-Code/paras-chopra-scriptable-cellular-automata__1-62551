  <p align="left">This program is an experimentation toolkit for a 2D cellular 
    automata. Cell Laboratory basically separates the rules and the field where 
    action is happening. It offers customizable rule and field system. It means, 
    a user is able to run the cellular automata using any of him custom rule. 
    This program offers Save/Open functionality for both rules and field.</p>
  <p align="left"><em>What is cellular automata?</em><br>
    Cellular automata is a field of AI. Cellular automata is implementation of 
    algorithm on a matrix of cells. This is 2D cellular automata because cells 
    are arranged in a columns and rows. There is a basic rule which determines 
    the state of a cell. By state I mean the condition of on or off of a cell. 
    In my implementation color black is on, while white is off.</p>
  <p align="left"><em>What do you mean by 'rule'?</em><br>
    By rule, I mean: a basic condition applied to each and every cell to determine 
    its current state. The current state is influenced by the previous state of 
    itself and/or the previous state of its neighbors.</p>
  <p align="left"><em>What do you mean by 'neighbours'?</em><br>
    In 2D, each cell is surrounded by 8 other cells. Take a look at any cell in 
    a spreadsheet application and count the number of cells surrounding that particular 
    cell. You'll find that it is 8. <br>
    Similarly, the number of neighbours in 1D is 2 and in 3D it is 26.</p>
  <p align="left">A graphical representation of cell's neighbours numbering from 
    1-8. This is the convention being used by the Cell Laboratory v1.0</p>
  <p align="centre">1 | 2 | 3 <br>
    4 | X | 5 <br>
    6 | 7 | 8</p>
  <p align="left"><em>Which is the default rule?</em><br>
    The default rule of the cellular automata by the rule called &quot;<strong>Conway's 
    game of life</strong>&quot;. It is a very famous rule and the most startling 
    one. It is basically defined as following:</p>
  <p align="left"><font size="3"> </font> 
  <div align="left"> 
    <pre><font size="3">If curcell = 0 Then<br>	If sumneb = 3 Then<br>		change = True<br>	End If<br>ElseIf curcell = 1 Then<br>	If sumneb &lt;&gt; 2 Then<br>		If sumneb &lt;&gt; 3 Then change = True<br>	End If<br>Else<br>	change = False<br>End If</font></pre>
    <p><font size="3">The code means that if the current cell if OFF (0) and the 
      3 of its neighbours are ON then turn the current cell ON. And also, if the 
      current cell is ON (1) and of 8 of its neighbours only total of 1,4,5,6,7 
      or 8 are ON then turn the current cell OFF.</font></p>
    <p><font size="3">This simple rule gives amazing results. Often self-replicating 
      or self-sustaining structures can be seen evolved.</font></p>

    <p align="center"><em>A screenshot of Cell Laboratory v1.0</em></p>
    <p>The controls are pretty self explanatory: 
    <ul>
      <li>'Run' starts the simulation process</li>
      <li> 'Pause' pasuses the simulation proces</li>
      <li>'Clear' turns all the cells to OFF state</li>
      <li>'Random' fills the cells with random states. The screenshot above is 
        the result of 'random' command.</li>
      <li>By clicking on Options you get a dialog wherein you may change rows 
        and columns and the sleep value.</li>
      <li>Sleep value is the time interval in milliseconds between the updation 
        of states in cellular automata</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may save or load the field or script. Field the total of all cells 
      in a CA. If you save a field and the later load it: then you will get exactly 
      same pattern of cells as on the time when you saved it.</p>

      Language</a></font></h3>
    <p><font size="3">The scripting language being used in this program is VBScript. 
      So It is being assumed that you know basic VBScript. </font></p>

      <div align="left"><font size="3">Additional terms included which are program 
        specific are:</font></div>
    </div>
<ul>
  <li>curcell : It means the state of the current cell. It is a read-only term. 
    It is equal to zero when the current cell is off and one when the current 
    cell is on.</li>
  <li> 
    <div align="left">neb() : It is a read only array. Its range is from 1-8. 
      It generally contains the state of neighbours 1-8. You may use it as neb(1) 
      which means the first neighbour. The neighbour location is:<br>
      <br>
      1 | 2 | 3 <br>
      4 | X | 5 <br>
      6 | 7 | 8 <br>
      <br>
      Where X is the current cell. Now when use use neb(1), it will return value 
      1 or 0, depending up whether first neighbouring cell is on or off.</div>
  </li>
  <li>sumofneb : It is a read only term. Its value is equal to: neb(1)+neb(2)+neb(3)+....+neb(8). 
    It represents the number of neighbours which are in ON state.</li>

</ul>
You may further clarify these concepts by experimenting with above terms.
